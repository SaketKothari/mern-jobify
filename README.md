This project is a comprehensive MERN stack application designed to provide a full-fledged platform with a dynamic front-end, robust back-end, and seamless integration between them. It covers a wide range of features, from user authentication to data visualization, making it a perfect example of a modern web application.

## Key Features

- 🏗 **Front-End Development with React:** Start from scratch with VITE to create a dynamic React front-end application. Learn to add global styles and build an array of user-friendly pages including Landing, Error, Register, and Dashboard.
- 🎨 **Stunning Visuals:** Master the art of setting up visually appealing images and layouts for a professional look and feel.
- 🌐 **Routing with React Router 6.4+:** Navigate the complexities of React Router for seamless page transitions and nested pages.
- 🖥 **Building a Server Application:** Dive into backend development by creating a server application from the ground up, utilizing ES6 modules and implementing the "nodemon" package for efficient development.
- 📊 **Database Management:** Gain hands-on experience in setting up a MongoDB database in the cloud with Atlas, crafting routes and controllers, and ensuring robust data handling.
- 🔍 **Testing and Error Handling:** Conduct extensive testing using Thunder Client, set up error handling in Express, and utilize the "express-async-errors" package for streamlined debugging.
- 🔐 **Security and Authentication:** Learn to hash passwords, implement JWT for secure authentication and authorization, and compare passwords to ensure user security.
- 🔗 **Full Stack Integration:** Connect your front-end application with the server, utilize the "concurrently" package, and set up a "proxy" in VITE for seamless full-stack integration.
- 🚀 **Advanced React Techniques:** Explore advanced functionalities in React, including programmatically navigating using React Router 6, setting up protected routes, and implementing logout features.
- 🌐 **API Management:** Master the use of Axios for API interactions, set JWT tokens in Postman, and implement various Axios configurations for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- 🛠 **CRUD and Permissions:** Achieve complete CRUD functionality, set up server permissions, and understand the nuances of creating and managing mock data.
- 📊 **Data Visualization and UI Enhancements:** Learn to set up informative charts and cards, and implement search/filter functionality for a user-friendly interface.
- 📄 **Pagination and Deployment:** Tackle pagination challenges and deploy your MERN application to Render for real-world use.

## Additional Features

- 🗂 **Modular Code Structure:** Maintain a clean and organized codebase with a modular structure.
- 📈 **Performance Optimization:** Implement best practices for performance optimization and efficient data handling.
- 🧩 **Custom Hooks and Context API:** Enhance your React application with custom hooks and Context API for state management.
- 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n):** Implement multilingual support to cater to a global audience.
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates with WebSockets:** Integrate WebSocket for real-time data updates and notifications.
- 🧩 **Third-Party Integrations:** Learn to integrate third-party services and APIs for added functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd server (Same with cd client)
    
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

2. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

3. Open [http://localhost:port](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
